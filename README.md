# Classification-with-Python
Generate a dataset with covidData() and split the data to do monte-carlo simulation of a training and test data. I will make classification models with knn and logistic regression methods. Packages of sklearn and matplotlib will be used to realize the project. And I will explain the key findings and comparisons of scores.
