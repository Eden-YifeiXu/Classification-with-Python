# Classification-with-Python
In file [Classification with Python.ipynb] I will generate a dataset with covidData() and split the data to do <b><i>monte-carlo</i></b> simulation of a training and test data. I will make classification models with <b>knn</b> and <b>logistic regression</b> methods. Packages of <b><i>sklearn</i></b> and <b><i>matplotlib</i></b> will be used to realize the project. And I will explain the key findings and comparisons of scores.

In file [Classification with Python Grid Search.ipynb] I will simulate a dataset to employ <b>knn</b>, <b>logistic regression</b> and <b> random forest</b> classification methods. This time I will include the usage of <b><i>Gridsearch</i></b> in package <b><i>sklearn</i></b>.
