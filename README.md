# Classification-with-Python
Generate a dataset with covidData() and split the data to do <b><i>monte-carlo</i></b> simulation of a training and test data. I will make classification models with <b>knn</b> and <b>logistic regression</b> methods. Packages of <b><i>sklearn</i></b> and <b><i>matplotlib</i></b> will be used to realize the project. And I will explain the key findings and comparisons of scores.
